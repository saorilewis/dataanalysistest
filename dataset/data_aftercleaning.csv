Plexiglas glazing is cut too large for the frame, causing the top and bottom right corners to sag away from the face, as well as causing the frame bottom right corner to split. Plexiglas needs to be replaced with an appropriate sized sheet when possible.  Crease in the central top edge is a partial tear, where only the top layer of the sheet is torn. Treatment to mend the tear and flatten the associated area is recommended. Localized humidification and pressing may be enough to diminish the buckling.  Micro-cracking in the paint is seen in the thickly applied areas in the central bottom. No active flaking of the paint is observed. Close monitoring is needed when travelling.",3-Treatment as necessary,,none,none

On sheet verso, an impression from the same stone is executed in light green ink, but not the rest. There are faint streaks of pink, brown, and blue inks unrelated to the design on verso. The paper has visible plant fiber inclusions. This is a loose print, attached to a modern exhibition 4-ply mat with thee paper v-hinges at top edge. The sheet has a fine-grid texture, which probably originates from previous fabric lining and adhesive used.  The sheet has pronounced planer distortion mainly along the four corners of the image area. Associated frequent tight creases are also present ca. 2"" along the side edges, as well as a 1 1/2"" and 2"" creases in the image center. There is a 1/4"" tear in the middle left edge and a minor 1/8"" loss in the top left corner. The sheet has faint foxing spots scattered overall, most noticeably in the margins. There are tidelines along the top left and right edges in margin, probably from removal of previous hinges.  It is suspected that the planer distortion formed when the print was unmounted from previous secondary support without proper drying process.",2-Treatment recommended,"primary support: Cream (3), Medium (1), Smooth
